        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "   - Compiled Languages:\n",
        "     - In compiled languages, the source code is translated into machine code (or an intermediate language) by a compiler before it is executed. This machine code is specific to the computer's architecture and is directly executed by the system's CPU.\n",
        "   - Interpreted Languages:\n",
        "     - In interpreted languages, the source code is executed directly by an interpreter line-by-line. The interpreter reads the high-level code and converts it to machine code on the fly, executing it immediately without the need for a separate compilation step.     \n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "   - Exception handling in Python refers to the process of catching and managing errors that occur during the execution of a program. It allows the program to handle runtime errors gracefully, rather than crashing, and enables the programmer to take appropriate actions when an error occurs.   \n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "   - The finally block in exception handling in Python is used to define code that must always be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This is particularly useful for performing cleanup actions or finalization tasks after a try-except block has been executed.\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "   - Logging in Python refers to the practice of recording events, messages, or errors that occur during the execution of a program. It helps developers track the behavior of an application, debug issues, and monitor the application's performance. Unlike print() statements, which are generally used for quick debugging or output, logging offers more flexibility, such as different log levels, timestamps, output formats, and the ability to log to files, consoles, or external systems.\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "   - The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as a destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected, i.e., when there are no more references to the object and Python's garbage collector deems it ready for cleanup.\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "   - import:\n",
        "     - The import statement is used to bring an entire module into your current script. When you use import, you need to refer to the module by its full name (i.e., module_name.something) when accessing any of its contents.\n",
        "     - import math  # Importing the entire math module     \n",
        "     print(math.sqrt(16))  # Using math.sqrt() to find square root  \n",
        "     print(math.pi)        # Accessing the constant math.pi\n",
        "  - from ... import:\n",
        "    - The from ... import statement allows you to import specific parts (such as functions, classes, or variables) of a module directly into your script. This way, you can use the imported items without needing to prefix them with the module name.\n",
        "    - from math import sqrt, pi  # Importing specific functions and\n",
        "      variables from math        \n",
        "      print(sqrt(16))  # No need to use 'math.sqrt()'\n",
        "      print(pi)        # No need to use 'math.pi'\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - Catching Multiple Exceptions in One except Block (Tuple Approach)\n",
        "  -  Using Multiple except Blocks (Different Blocks for Different Exceptions)\n",
        "  - Catching All Exceptions (Generic except)\n",
        "  - Handling Exceptions with Different Actions (Multiple Blocks with Custom Handling)\n",
        "  - Using else with try-except to Handle Non-Exceptions\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "   - The with statement in Python is used to simplify the management of resources, such as files, ensuring that they are properly acquired and released. When working with files, the with statement automatically handles opening and closing the file, even if an exception occurs within the block. This prevents resource leaks and reduces the need for manual cleanup.\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "   - Multithreading:\n",
        "     - Multithreading refers to the execution of multiple threads within a single process. A thread is a smaller unit of a process, and multithreading allows the CPU to switch between threads within the same process, executing them concurrently.\n",
        "     - Threads within the same process share the same memory space and resources, which means they can communicate easily but also must be careful about thread synchronization to avoid conflicts (e.g., race conditions).\n",
        "     - It provides concurrency, which means tasks can be executed seemingly simultaneously (but may not actually run simultaneously, depending on the number of available CPU cores).\n",
        "     - Due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. This means that Python threads are not truly parallel in CPU-bound tasks but can be beneficial for I/O-bound tasks (like file operations, web requests, etc.).\n",
        "     - Best suited for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading/writing to files, network requests, web scraping).\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing:\n",
        "    - Multiprocessing refers to the use of multiple processes, where each process runs in its own memory space. Each process is independent and can run on a separate CPU core, achieving true parallelism.  \n",
        "    - Each process in multiprocessing has its own memory space, and they run independently of each other. This enables true parallelism since processes can run on different CPU cores.\n",
        "    - There is no GIL in multiprocessing, so CPU-bound tasks (which require heavy computation) benefit from multiprocessing since they can run simultaneously on multiple cores, fully utilizing the hardware.\n",
        "    - However, inter-process communication (IPC) is more complex and slower compared to threads since they don't share memory directly.\n",
        "    - Best suited for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., mathematical computations, image processing, data analysis) where parallel execution across multiple CPU cores can significantly improve performance.    \n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "    - Debugging and Troubleshooting\n",
        "    - Audit Trails and Monitoring\n",
        "    - Granular Control of Logging Output\n",
        "    - Centralized Logging\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "    - Python uses a private heap to store all Python objects and data structures.\n",
        "    - The Python memory manager handles the allocation and deallocation of memory within this heap.\n",
        "    - Python keeps track of how many times an object is referenced.\n",
        "    - When the reference count of an object drops to zero, it means the object is no longer accessible and can be safely deallocated.\n",
        "    - Python employs a garbage collector to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable, even if their reference count is not zero.\n",
        "    - This helps prevent memory leaks and ensures efficient memory utilization.\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "    - Try Block (Code That Might Raise an Exception)\n",
        "    - Except Block (Handling the Exception)\n",
        "    - Else Block (Optional)\n",
        "    - Finally Block (Optional)\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "    - Prevents Memory Leaks: Ensures that memory is reclaimed when objects are no longer in use.\n",
        "    - Improves Performance: Reduces system overhead and fragmentation, improving program speed.\n",
        "    - Supports Large Data Handling: Makes it easier to process large datasets without running out of memory.\n",
        "    - Ensures Stability and Scalability: Allows programs to scale efficiently and maintain stability as they grow.\n",
        "    - Facilitates Debugging: Enables you to identify and resolve memory-related issues using profiling tools.\n",
        "    - Reduces Developer Workload: Automatic garbage collection helps reduce the need for manual memory management.\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "    - In Python, try and except blocks play a fundamental role in exception handling. They allow the program to manage errors gracefully and continue execution even when an exception (error) occurs. Let’s break down the roles of try and except in exception handling:\n",
        "    - The try block is where you write the code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "    - The except block is used to catch and handle exceptions that occur in the try block.\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "    - Python's garbage collection system is designed to automatically manage memory, reclaim unused memory, and prevent memory leaks. It primarily uses reference counting and generational garbage collection to achieve this.\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "    - The else block in exception handling in Python is used to define code that should run if no exceptions are raised in the associated try block. It is placed after the except blocks, and its primary purpose is to execute code that depends on the successful execution of the try block. If no exceptions occur during the execution of the try block, the code inside the else block will be executed.\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "    - CRITICAL (50)\n",
        "    - ERROR (40)\n",
        "    - WARNING (30)\n",
        "    - INFO (20)\n",
        "    - DEBUG (10)\n",
        "    - NOTSET (0)\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "    - os.fork() is a system call available in Python that creates a child process by duplicating the current (parent) process. It is a lower-level way to create new processes and is available only on Unix-like operating systems (Linux, macOS).\n",
        "    - The multiprocessing module is a high-level Python library for creating and managing parallel processes. It provides a more Pythonic, abstracted way of creating and managing separate processes in a cross-platform manner.\n",

        "    -  file.read()\n",
        "       - Reads the entire content of the file as a single string.\n",
        "    - file.readline()\n",
        "      - Reads one line at a time from the file.\n",
